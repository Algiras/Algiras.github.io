## Implementation Notes

- We're using React with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite is being used as the build tool for its speed and modern defaults
- TailwindCSS is used for styling
- React Router handles navigation between pages
- i18next provides internationalization support
- React hooks are used for state management

## Future Considerations

- Theme switching (light/dark mode)
- Additional calculators or tools that might be relevant
- Performance optimizations for larger datasets
