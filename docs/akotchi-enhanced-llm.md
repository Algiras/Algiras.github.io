# Akotchi Enhanced LLM Message Generation

## Overview

The Akotchi game now features significantly enhanced AI-powered message generation that creates personality-driven, engaging, and context-aware messages for your virtual pet. Using an on-device language model, Akotchi can now express needs, respond to care, and interact in a much more natural and engaging way.

## Key Features

### **Personality-Driven Messages**
Each Akotchi has a unique personality that influences how they communicate:

- **Cheerful**: Always positive, enthusiastic, very social
- **Lazy**: Gentle requests, appreciates comfort, prefers calm
- **Hyper**: Energetic requests, wants action, very playful
- **Moody**: Emotional requests, needs reassurance, sensitive
- **Shy**: Gentle, quiet requests, appreciates patience

### **Context-Aware Communication**
Messages are generated based on:
- Current stats (hunger, energy, happiness, health)
- Pet's age and growth stage
- Recent actions taken
- Current emotional state
- Specific needs requiring attention

### **Multiple Message Types**
1. **Proactive Requests**: When Akotchi needs something
2. **Action Responses**: After receiving care
3. **General Chat**: When you ask "What's up?"
4. **Crying Messages**: When extremely unhappy

## How It Works

### **Proactive Message Generation**
When Akotchi needs something, the system automatically generates a personality-appropriate request:

```
Hungry Cheerful Pet: "I'm getting hungry! Can you feed me something yummy?"
Tired Lazy Pet: "I'm feeling sleepy and would love a cozy nap"
Sad Moody Pet: "I'm feeling a bit lonely, can we play together?"
```

### **Action Response Messages**
After you care for Akotchi, they respond with gratitude:

```
After Feeding: "That was delicious! I feel so much better now, thank you!"
After Playing: "That was so much fun! I love playing with you!"
After Sleeping: "I feel so rested and cozy now, that was perfect!"
After Cleaning: "I feel so fresh and clean! Thank you for taking care of me!"
After Healing: "I'm feeling much better now! Your care really helps!"
After Scolding: "I understand, I'll try to be better. Thank you for teaching me."
```
