## Test Philosophy

These tests focus on:
- **Business Logic**: Core calculation accuracy
- **Input Validation**: Proper error handling for invalid inputs
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and extreme values
- **Mathematical Accuracy**: Precise financial calculations
- **Reliability**: Consistent results across different scenarios

The tests do NOT cover:
- UI components (handled by integration tests if needed)
- Chart rendering (handled by visual tests if needed)
- User interactions (handled by E2E tests if needed)
